egdol â€” autonomous reasoning architecture
==========================================

A research-oriented rule-based reasoning system implementing multi-layered autonomous intelligence through deterministic computation. The system operates entirely offline, requiring zero external dependencies while providing comprehensive reasoning capabilities across multiple abstraction levels.

Architecture Overview
--------------------

The system implements a hierarchical reasoning architecture consisting of six distinct layers, each building upon the previous to create increasingly sophisticated autonomous behaviors:

**Core Reasoning Engine**
The foundation layer provides Prolog-style rule and fact processing with unification-based inference. The engine supports recursive rule application, constraint satisfaction, and depth-first proof search with configurable depth limits. All reasoning operations are deterministic and fully traceable.

**Network Intelligence Layer**
Multi-agent coordination system enabling distributed reasoning across specialized agent types. Agents communicate through structured message passing with built-in conflict resolution and consensus mechanisms. The network maintains global state consistency while allowing local autonomy.

**Strategic Autonomy Layer**
High-level planning and goal management system capable of autonomous objective generation, scenario simulation, and risk assessment. The strategic layer operates on abstract representations of problems and generates concrete action plans through constraint-based optimization.

**Experimental Intelligence Layer**
Research and knowledge discovery system implementing hypothesis generation, experimental design, and result synthesis. The experimental layer can autonomously design and execute research protocols, analyze outcomes, and integrate new knowledge into the existing knowledge base.

**Meta-Intelligence Layer**
Self-modification and system evolution capabilities enabling the architecture to invent new reasoning strategies, modify its own structure, and optimize its performance. The meta-layer operates on the system itself, creating feedback loops for continuous improvement.

**Reflexive Self-Improvement Layer**
Real-time conversation auditing and meta-learning system that analyzes interaction patterns, identifies performance gaps, and applies heuristic refinements. The reflexive layer enables the system to evolve its reasoning strategies based on actual usage patterns.

Core Engine Implementation
--------------------------

The core engine provides the fundamental reasoning capabilities through several specialized components:

**Lexical Analysis** (`egdol/lexer.py`)
Implements a domain-specific language parser for rule and fact definitions. The lexer handles recursive structures, variable binding, and constraint specifications while maintaining strict syntax validation.

**Abstract Syntax Tree** (`egdol/parser.py`)
Constructs parse trees for facts, rules, and queries with full support for nested structures and complex logical expressions. The parser enforces semantic correctness and provides detailed error reporting.

**Rule Engine** (`egdol/rules_engine.py`)
Manages fact and rule storage with efficient indexing for fast retrieval. Supports constraint satisfaction, rule ordering, and conflict resolution. The engine maintains consistency guarantees and provides comprehensive query capabilities.

**Unification Engine** (`egdol/interpreter.py`)
Implements unification-based inference with depth-first search and configurable depth limits. The interpreter handles recursive rule application, variable binding, and constraint propagation while maintaining deterministic behavior.

**Interactive Environment** (`egdol/main.py`)
Provides a read-eval-print loop for interactive exploration of the reasoning system. The environment supports session persistence, batch processing, and comprehensive debugging capabilities.

OmniMind Autonomous Systems
---------------------------

The OmniMind system extends the core engine with sophisticated autonomous capabilities organized into specialized subsystems:

**Conversational Intelligence** (`egdol/omnimind/conversational/`)
Multi-personality reasoning system with context-aware response generation. The system maintains conversation state, tracks intent evolution, and provides fallback mechanisms for edge cases. Each personality operates with distinct reasoning patterns and knowledge domains.

**Network Coordination** (`egdol/omnimind/network/`)
Distributed agent communication system enabling collaborative reasoning across multiple specialized agents. The network layer handles message routing, conflict resolution, and consensus formation while maintaining system-wide consistency.

**Strategic Planning** (`egdol/omnimind/strategic/`)
Autonomous goal generation and planning system capable of multi-step reasoning, scenario analysis, and risk assessment. The strategic layer operates on abstract problem representations and generates concrete action sequences.

**Experimental Research** (`egdol/omnimind/experimental/`)
Autonomous research system implementing hypothesis generation, experimental design, and knowledge synthesis. The experimental layer can design research protocols, execute investigations, and integrate findings into the knowledge base.

**Meta-Learning Architecture** (`egdol/omnimind/meta/`)
Self-modification system enabling the architecture to evolve its own structure and capabilities. The meta-layer analyzes system performance, identifies optimization opportunities, and implements structural improvements.

**Reflexive Self-Improvement** (`egdol/omnimind/conversational/`)
Real-time learning system that audits conversation turns, extracts performance patterns, and applies heuristic refinements. The reflexive layer enables continuous improvement based on actual interaction data.

Advanced Capabilities
---------------------

**Constraint Satisfaction**
The system implements sophisticated constraint satisfaction algorithms for complex reasoning problems. Constraints can be specified declaratively and are automatically propagated during inference.

**Parallel Execution**
Multi-threaded reasoning capabilities enable concurrent processing of independent subproblems. The parallel execution system maintains determinism while providing significant performance improvements for complex queries.

**Profiling and Analysis**
Built-in profiling system provides detailed performance metrics and bottleneck identification. The profiler tracks execution times, memory usage, and rule application patterns.

**Persistent Memory**
Session persistence enables long-term learning and knowledge accumulation. The system maintains conversation history, learned patterns, and evolved heuristics across sessions.

**Deterministic Behavior**
All reasoning operations are fully deterministic and reproducible. The system provides complete traceability for all inference steps and maintains consistent behavior across executions.

Usage Patterns
--------------

**Interactive Exploration**
The read-eval-print loop provides immediate access to reasoning capabilities with comprehensive debugging support. Users can explore rule interactions, test hypotheses, and analyze inference patterns in real-time.

**Batch Processing**
The system supports batch processing of rule sets and query sequences for large-scale reasoning tasks. Batch operations maintain full determinism while providing significant performance improvements.

**Multi-Agent Coordination**
Distributed reasoning across multiple specialized agents enables complex problem decomposition and collaborative solution generation. The network layer handles coordination automatically while maintaining system-wide consistency.

**Autonomous Research**
The experimental intelligence layer can autonomously design and execute research protocols, analyze results, and integrate new knowledge. This capability enables the system to expand its own knowledge base through systematic investigation.

**Self-Modification**
The meta-intelligence layer enables the system to analyze its own performance, identify optimization opportunities, and implement structural improvements. This creates feedback loops for continuous system evolution.

**Reflexive Learning**
The reflexive self-improvement layer analyzes conversation patterns, identifies performance gaps, and applies heuristic refinements in real-time. This enables the system to evolve its reasoning strategies based on actual usage patterns.

Performance Characteristics
------------------------

The system is designed for research and educational use with emphasis on clarity and determinism over raw performance. Typical performance characteristics:

- Rule application: O(n) where n is the number of applicable rules
- Unification: O(m) where m is the complexity of the unification problem
- Constraint satisfaction: O(c^v) where c is constraint complexity and v is variable count
- Multi-agent coordination: O(a^2) where a is the number of active agents
