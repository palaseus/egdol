egdol Quick Start Guide
======================

This guide provides practical instruction for exploring the egdol autonomous reasoning system. The system operates through multiple interfaces, each designed for specific exploration patterns and research objectives.

Core Engine Interface
---------------------

**Interactive Reasoning Environment**

Start the core reasoning engine:

```bash
python3 -m egdol.main
```

The interactive environment provides immediate access to rule-based reasoning capabilities with comprehensive debugging support.

**Basic Fact and Rule Operations**

Define facts using the `fact:` directive:

```
fact: human(socrates).
fact: human(plato).
fact: mortal(socrates).
```

Define rules using the `rule:` directive with logical implications:

```
rule: mortal(X) => human(X).
rule: philosopher(X) => human(X).
```

Query the knowledge base using the `?` operator:

```
? mortal(socrates).
? mortal(X).
? philosopher(socrates).
```

**Advanced Rule Construction**

Rules support complex logical structures and recursive definitions:

```
rule: ancestor(X, Y) => parent(X, Y).
rule: ancestor(X, Z) => parent(X, Y), ancestor(Y, Z).
rule: sibling(X, Y) => parent(Z, X), parent(Z, Y), X != Y.
```

Constraints can be specified using inequality operators:

```
rule: different(X, Y) => X != Y.
```

**Interactive Commands**

The environment provides several commands for system exploration:

- `:facts` — Display all loaded facts
- `:rules` — Display all loaded rules  
- `:trace on|off` — Enable/disable inference tracing
- `:load <file>` — Load facts and rules from file
- `:save <file>` — Save current session to file
- `:clear` — Clear all facts and rules
- `:help` — Display command reference

**Inference Tracing**

Enable detailed inference tracing to observe the reasoning process:

```
:trace on
? ancestor(alice, charlie).
```

Tracing reveals the complete proof tree, showing each rule application and variable binding step.

**Session Persistence**

Save reasoning sessions for later analysis:

```
:save research_session.egdol
:load research_session.egdol
```

OmniMind Conversational Interface
--------------------------------

**Multi-Personality Reasoning System**

Access the conversational intelligence layer:

```bash
python3 -m egdol.omnimind
```

The conversational interface provides context-aware reasoning through specialized personality agents.

**Personality-Based Reasoning**

The system operates through distinct personality agents, each with specialized reasoning patterns:

- **Strategos**: Strategic planning and tactical reasoning
- **Archivist**: Knowledge organization and retrieval
- **Lawmaker**: Legal reasoning and compliance analysis
- **Oracle**: Abstract reasoning and philosophical inquiry

**Conversation State Management**

The system maintains persistent conversation context across interactions:

```
User: Analyze the strategic implications of renewable energy adoption
OmniMind: [Strategos] Commander, I recommend a phased deployment strategy...
User: What are the legal considerations?
OmniMind: [Lawmaker] From a regulatory perspective, we must ensure...
```

**Context-Aware Reasoning**

The system tracks conversation evolution and maintains context across multiple turns:

```
User: Define the problem space
OmniMind: [Archivist] I shall catalog the problem dimensions...
User: How do we approach this systematically?
OmniMind: [Strategos] Based on the problem space you've defined...
```

**Fallback Mechanisms**

When specialized reasoning fails, the system provides intelligent fallback responses:

```
User: Explain quantum entanglement
OmniMind: [Oracle] Through the veil of existence, I see that quantum mechanics...
```

Advanced System Capabilities
----------------------------

**Reflexive Self-Improvement**

The system includes real-time conversation auditing and meta-learning capabilities:

```python
from egdol.omnimind.conversational import (
    ReflexiveAuditModule,
    MetaLearningEngine,
    PersonalityEvolutionEngine
)

# Initialize reflexive components
audit_module = ReflexiveAuditModule()
meta_learning = MetaLearningEngine()
personality_evolution = PersonalityEvolutionEngine(meta_learning, audit_module)

# Process conversation turn
conversation_turn = ConversationTurn(
    turn_id="turn_1",
    user_input="Analyze strategic options",
    system_response="Commander, I recommend tactical approach...",
    personality_used="Strategos",
    confidence_score=0.8
)

# Audit conversation performance
audit_result = audit_module.audit_conversation_turn(conversation_turn)
print(f"Audit Score: {audit_result.confidence_score}")
print(f"Metrics: {audit_result.metrics}")

# Generate learning insights
insights = meta_learning.generate_insights_from_turn(turn_data)
print(f"Generated {len(insights)} learning insights")
```

**Multi-Agent Coordination**

The system supports distributed reasoning across multiple specialized agents:

```python
from egdol.omnimind.network import AgentNetwork

# Initialize agent network
network = AgentNetwork()

# Create specialized agents
strategic_agent = network.create_agent("strategic", "Strategos")
research_agent = network.create_agent("research", "Archivist")

# Coordinate distributed reasoning
task = "Analyze renewable energy adoption strategies"
result = network.coordinate_reasoning(task, [strategic_agent, research_agent])
```

**Strategic Planning**

Access autonomous goal generation and planning capabilities:

```python
from egdol.omnimind.strategic import StrategicPlanner

planner = StrategicPlanner()

# Generate strategic objectives
objectives = planner.generate_objectives("energy_transition")

# Create execution plan
plan = planner.create_execution_plan(objectives)

# Simulate scenario outcomes
scenarios = planner.simulate_scenarios(plan)
```

**Experimental Research**

The system can autonomously design and execute research protocols:

```python
from egdol.omnimind.experimental import ResearchEngine

research = ResearchEngine()

# Generate research hypothesis
hypothesis = research.generate_hypothesis("renewable_energy_adoption")

# Design experimental protocol
protocol = research.design_protocol(hypothesis)

# Execute research and analyze results
results = research.execute_research(protocol)
analysis = research.analyze_results(results)
```

**Meta-Learning and Self-Modification**

The system can analyze its own performance and implement structural improvements:

```python
from egdol.omnimind.meta import MetaLearningEngine

meta_engine = MetaLearningEngine()

# Analyze system performance
performance_data = meta_engine.analyze_performance()

# Identify optimization opportunities
optimizations = meta_engine.identify_optimizations(performance_data)

# Implement structural improvements
improvements = meta_engine.implement_improvements(optimizations)
```

System Profiling and Analysis

**Performance Profiling**

The system includes comprehensive profiling capabilities for performance analysis:

```
:profile summary
:profile top 10
:profile export-json performance_data.json
:profile analyze
```

**Rule Application Analysis**

Analyze rule usage patterns and optimization opportunities:

```
:profile rules
:profile bottlenecks
:profile memory_usage
```

**Multi-Agent Performance**

profiler = NetworkProfiler()
metrics = profiler.get_network_metrics()
print(f"Agent coordination efficiency: {metrics.coordination_efficiency}")
print(f"Message throughput: {metrics.message_throughput}")
